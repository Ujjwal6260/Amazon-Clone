# Amazon-Clone
This is my first project, I made using HTML+CSS, I'm so excited to show  you guys my Amazon Clone. 

The Amazon clone is a web application that replicates the core functionality of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon. Users can browse through a wide range of products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout to place orders. The application includes user authentication to secure user accounts and order history to track previous purchases. Additionally, there is an admin panel for managing products, allowing administrators to add, edit, and delete products from the catalog. The Amazon clone provides a familiar and user-friendly shopping experience similar to the original Amazon website.
